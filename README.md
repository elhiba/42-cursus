# 42-cursus

Welcome to my cursus journey at 1337 School! Here's a repository documenting my progress, solutions, and learning derived from the exciting and challenging projects that the 42 Network has to offer. Being the proud student of 1337, I just love the peer-to-peer and project-based learning system that eventually pushes us to self-dependent problem solvers and collaborative coders.

That means this cursus is not about coding, but about developing resilience, precision, and creativity to go through the complex challenges, following the high standards imposed by the 42 philosophy. I would like to share with you my work, growth, and contribution to the community through this repository.
